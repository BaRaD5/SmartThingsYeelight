# SmartThingsYeelight

Allows control of Yeelight Bulb from SmartThings

No discovery, just input the IP address of the bulb in the settings page

Need to add in the Yeelight APP first and enable LAN Control in the APP

Need to make the Device Network Id in the ST IDE to be the hex IP and port
ie abcdefgh:d893
